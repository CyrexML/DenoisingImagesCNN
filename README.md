# DenoisingImagesCNN
This project is designed to show how convolutional neural networks can reconstruct images that have been contaminated by noise. For this purpose two codes will be created, the first **ZaszumienieObraz√≥w** serves to add noise to clean images, the complete database with them can be found in the file **Obrazy**. The second code shows the process of creating the Convolutional Autoencoder, as well as applying it to Contaminated images from the **ObrazySzum1** folder.  

In this project in the code when building CNN for machines with less Ram (<16 GB) a limited database of images (~1000) is used, it is located in the **Obrazy2** file, for machines with more Ram it is recommended to use full database (~6500) from the **Obrazy1** file.

In the future this project will be developed in order to improve the performance of CNN for more accurate clearing of images from noise.
